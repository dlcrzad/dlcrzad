# Email Configuration for Contact Form
# =====================================
# For Gmail, you MUST use an App Password (not your regular Gmail password)
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to myaccount.google.com
# 2. Click "Security" in the left sidebar
# 3. Enable "2-Step Verification" (if not already enabled)
# 4. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 5. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or your platform)
# 6. Google will generate a 16-character password
# 7. Copy that password below (remove spaces)
#
# Example:
# EMAIL_FROM=dlcrzad@gmail.com
# EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop (without spaces: abcdefghijklmnop)
